# =============================================================================
# Identical, generic script to sibling repo URTC's own bump_version.py
# (copied rather than reinvented - it already takes the header path and
# macro prefix as arguments, nothing URTC-specific to adapt). Increments
# ONE component's own version macros in its header, in place, before that
# component gets compiled.
#
# POLICY: every real build (a compile+link that produces a fresh .bin, not
# just a source edit) bumps that component's own PATCH by 1, automatically,
# before the compiler ever reads its header. "Odometer" carry: patch += 1;
# if patch > 9: patch = 0, minor += 1; if minor > 9 (checked
# unconditionally, so a minor already at 9 for any other reason still
# carries): minor = 0, major += 1.
#
# Usage: python3 bump_version.py <header_path> <MACRO_PREFIX> [<mirror_header>]
#   header_path    path to the component's own header (bootloader_common.h /
#                  slaveboot_common.h for a bootloader; firmware_common.h /
#                  slave_common.h for an application).
#   MACRO_PREFIX   "BOOTLOADER_VERSION" or "FIRMWARE_VERSION" - touches only
#                  that macro family's own _MAJOR/_MINOR/_PATCH #defines.
#   mirror_header  OPTIONAL. Only meaningful when MACRO_PREFIX is
#                  FIRMWARE_VERSION: each bootloader keeps its own copy of
#                  FIRMWARE_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH (the version of
#                  whatever application image is currently installed - used
#                  by ApplicationIsValid()'s first-boot-adoption path and by
#                  the anti-rollback check in HandleEndUpdate, see
#                  bootloader_protocol.c) rather than #including the
#                  application's own header, since the two never build
#                  together. Without this argument that copy can silently
#                  drift from the real application version - which is
#                  exactly what happened before this script existed:
#                  bootloader_common.h's own copy sat at FIRMWARE_VERSION_MINOR
#                  0 while firmware_common.h (the real application) had
#                  already moved to 1. When mirror_header is given, this
#                  script writes the SAME new MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH into that
#                  file's own FIRMWARE_VERSION_* macros right after bumping
#                  the primary header, so the two can never drift apart
#                  again as long as every real app build goes through here.
#
# Prints the new "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" to stdout on success (nothing else, so
# a caller can capture it directly); exits non-zero with a message on stderr
# if the expected #defines aren't found in EITHER file - never writes a
# partial/inconsistent header, and never writes the primary header if the
# mirror write would fail.
